                    <p>Agile methodology in Dynamics 365 CRM helps ensure that the final product is not only functional but continuously aligned with business goals, allowing for better user adoption and higher satisfaction.</p>
                    <h5>Waterfall Methodology</h5>
                    <p>The Waterfall methodology is a traditional, linear approach to project management, where each phase of the Dynamics 365 CRM implementation is completed sequentially. This means that the project progresses through distinct stages—requirements gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance—without revisiting previous phases. Waterfall is best suited for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal changes throughout the process, making it ideal for organizations that have a clear vision of their CRM needs and expect little alteration in scope during the implementation.</p>
                    <p>Key advantages of using Waterfall methodology for Dynamics 365 CRM include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Clear Project Phases: Each phase of the project is defined and completed before moving to the next, providing a structured approach that ensures all requirements are met.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Predictable Timelines and Costs: With a set plan in place from the start, Waterfall allows for accurate scheduling and budgeting, making it easier to track progress.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Thorough Documentation: The Waterfall approach emphasizes detailed documentation at each stage, ensuring that every aspect of the project is thoroughly understood and can be referred back to if needed.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Minimal Scope Creep: Since all requirements are defined upfront, Waterfall minimizes the risk of scope changes during the implementation, leading to a more controlled project environment.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Waterfall can offer predictability and structure, it is best suited for projects with fixed, well-understood requirements and limited flexibility for changes during the execution phase.
                    </p>
