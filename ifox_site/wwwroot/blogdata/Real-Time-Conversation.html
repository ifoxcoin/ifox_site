            <h1>🎧 Real-Time Conversation Intelligence in Dynamics 365</h1>

            <p>
                In modern sales and customer service environments, conversations are where
                the real business happens. Every customer call, virtual meeting, and
                interaction contains valuable signals about intent, risk, and opportunity.
            </p>

            <p>
                Dynamics 365 Copilot introduces <strong>real-time conversation intelligence</strong>,
                enabling organizations to capture, analyze, and act on customer interactions
                as they happen — not after the fact.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                Real-time conversation intelligence transforms live customer interactions
                into actionable insights that improve sales outcomes and service quality.
            </div>

            <h2>The Visibility Gap in Traditional Conversations</h2>

            <p>
                Historically, most customer conversations were either underutilized or
                reviewed long after they occurred. Managers relied on manual call reviews,
                rep notes, or basic recordings to understand what happened.
            </p>

            <h3>Common challenges include:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Limited visibility into live customer calls</li>
                <li>Delayed coaching for sales reps</li>
                <li>Missed buying signals</li>
                <li>Inconsistent call quality</li>
                <li>Lack of data-driven conversation insights</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                These gaps make it difficult to optimize customer engagement in real time.
            </p>

            <h2>How Real-Time Conversation Intelligence Works</h2>

            <p>
                Dynamics 365 Copilot uses advanced speech analytics and AI models to
                analyze conversations during calls and meetings.
            </p>

            <p>
                The system evaluates:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Keywords and topic detection</li>
                <li>Customer sentiment and tone</li>
                <li>Talk-to-listen ratios</li>
                <li>Objection signals</li>
                <li>Competitive mentions</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Insights are surfaced in real time, enabling sales and service teams to
                adjust their approach during the conversation itself.
            </p>
