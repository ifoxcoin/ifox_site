            <h1>🎯 Next-Best Action Recommendations in Dynamics 365</h1>

            <p>
                Modern sales is no longer just about tracking opportunities — it's about knowing
                exactly what to do next to move a deal forward. Many sales representatives struggle
                not because of lack of effort, but because they lack timely, data-driven guidance.
            </p>

            <p>
                Dynamics 365 Copilot solves this challenge with intelligent <strong>
                    Next-Best Action
                    recommendations
                </strong>, helping sales teams prioritize the right activities at the
                right time.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                Copilot continuously analyzes customer data, engagement signals, and pipeline activity
                to recommend the most impactful next step for every opportunity.
            </div>

            <h2>The Problem with Traditional Sales Decision-Making</h2>

            <p>
                In many organizations, determining the next step in a sales cycle depends heavily on
                individual experience and manual analysis. This often leads to inconsistent execution
                and missed opportunities.
            </p>

            <h3>Common challenges include:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Unclear follow-up priorities</li>
                <li>Delayed customer engagement</li>
                <li>Overlooked high-value opportunities</li>
                <li>Inconsistent sales processes</li>
                <li>Heavy reliance on manual pipeline reviews</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Without intelligent guidance, even experienced sales teams can lose momentum in
                competitive deals.
            </p>

            <h2>How Copilot Determines the Next-Best Action</h2>
