            <h1>🛠️ Customer Service Case Summaries with Copilot</h1>

            <p>
                Customer service teams handle large volumes of support cases every day.
                Quickly understanding the history of a case is critical for delivering
                fast and accurate resolutions. However, manually reviewing long case
                timelines can slow agents down and impact customer satisfaction.
            </p>

            <p>
                Dynamics 365 Copilot transforms service operations with <strong>
                    AI-powered
                    case summarization
                </strong>, enabling agents to instantly understand
                customer issues, previous interactions, and next steps.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                Copilot automatically generates concise, contextual summaries of customer
                service cases — helping agents resolve issues faster and more efficiently.
            </div>

            <h2>The Challenge with Traditional Case Reviews</h2>

            <p>
                In many service environments, agents must manually read through case notes,
                emails, chat transcripts, and activity logs before taking action.
                This process is time-consuming and prone to oversight.
            </p>

            <h3>Common pain points include:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Long case histories to review</li>
                <li>Delayed response times</li>
                <li>Inconsistent case understanding</li>
                <li>Agent onboarding challenges</li>
                <li>Reduced first-contact resolution rates</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                These inefficiencies can negatively affect both agent productivity
                and customer experience.
            </p>

            <h2>How Copilot Case Summaries Work</h2>

            <p>
                Copilot uses generative AI and natural language processing to analyze
                all activities associated with a customer service case.
            </p>

            <p>
                The AI reviews:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Case notes and comments</li>
                <li>Email conversations</li>
                <li>Chat transcripts</li>
                <li>Call logs</li>
                <li>Status changes and activities</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                It then produces a clear, structured summary highlighting the most
                important information.
            </p>
