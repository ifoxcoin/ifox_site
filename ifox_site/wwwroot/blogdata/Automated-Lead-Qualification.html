            <h1>🤖 Automated Lead Qualification Using AI</h1>

            <p>
                One of the biggest challenges in modern sales is identifying which leads
                are truly worth pursuing. Sales teams often spend valuable time chasing
                low-quality prospects while high-potential opportunities may not receive
                the attention they deserve.
            </p>

            <p>
                Dynamics 365 Copilot addresses this problem through <strong>
                    AI-powered lead
                    qualification
                </strong>, helping organizations automatically prioritize,
                score, and route leads based on their likelihood to convert.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                Copilot analyzes behavioral signals, engagement patterns, and historical
                data to identify the leads most likely to become customers.
            </div>

            <h2>The Problem with Manual Lead Qualification</h2>

            <p>
                Traditionally, lead qualification depends heavily on manual review,
                basic scoring rules, or sales intuition. While these methods work to
                some extent, they often lack accuracy and scalability.
            </p>

            <h3>Common challenges include:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Large volumes of unqualified leads</li>
                <li>Time wasted on low-intent prospects</li>
                <li>Inconsistent scoring criteria</li>
                <li>Delayed follow-up on hot leads</li>
                <li>Limited visibility into lead quality</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                These inefficiencies can significantly impact conversion rates and
                overall sales productivity.
            </p>

            <h2>How AI Lead Qualification Works</h2>

            <p>
                Copilot uses machine learning models trained on historical CRM data
                to evaluate incoming leads in real time.
            </p>

            <p>
                The AI considers multiple signals, including:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Website and marketing engagement</li>
                <li>Email interaction patterns</li>
                <li>Demographic and firmographic data</li>
                <li>Past conversion history</li>
                <li>Sales activity signals</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Based on this analysis, leads are automatically scored and prioritized,
                enabling sales teams to focus on the highest-value opportunities first.
            </p>

            <h2>Key Capabilities</h2>
